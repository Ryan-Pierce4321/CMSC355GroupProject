------------------ Fill in some information about your project under this ------------------
  The project will create a mental health app using java. This app will use a java swing gui to interface with
the user. The mental health app will allow the user to create an account that is protected with a
password and has a unique username. This program will enable users to log their responses to mood
questions every day and store the inputted mood and dates for later use. It will allow the user to
request access to the stored information, as well as create a graph for the user to look at to gauge how
their mental state has changed over time. It also will have all information stored locally, and will be
capable of containing up to 10 different accounts.
